## Local Dev

This project uses Node for local development.

To get the latest version of Node v12, [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is
recommended:

```sh
nvm use 12
```

[`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) is used to
manage packages and run scripts. Once that's set up, the dependencies can be
installed as:

```sh
yarn install
```

To run the server locally:

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Deployment
